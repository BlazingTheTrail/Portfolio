## About
Hello, I'm Xiang Ding, a results-driven Data Analyst with seven years of experience in end-to-end data analysis, SQL, data governance, and predictive modeling. I'm proficient in analyzing complex datasets to deliver actionable business insights using tools like MySQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. Additionally, I'm adept at designing and implementing data models, ETL processes, and dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

It is my Master's degree in International Studies with a focus on economics that introduced me to quantitative methods through courses in mathematics, statistics, and econometrics. This sparked my interest in data and its applications.
 
Subsequently, as a sovereign credit rating analyst at Lianhe Credit Rating, I gained practical experience in data collection, mining, quality assessment, and analysis. I was instrumental in developing the company's first sovereign rating model, collaborating closely with the IT department.
 
Recognizing the need for a more systematic foundation in data science, I completed a Data Science Diploma at the Toronto Institute of Data Science and Technology. This program equipped me with a comprehensive skill set, including proficiency in Python, SQL, machine learning, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. I also had the opportunity to apply my knowledge through several impactful projects.
 
Building on this academic and practical experience, I have successfully delivered two projects as a data science consultant at Beam Data.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Here is my latest [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncr365smFmqbMyszQh5mLmkRRyQU_vFcGpKqMNcOIzI/edit) for your reference.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
